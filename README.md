Project 4 - React / Django

# Élan

I created a React Shopping app designed to sell a unique and time limited luxury leisurewear.
Aesthetically I wanted to aim to corner the gym/run club goer; with dark tones on some of the pages and a more natural look for the explore page.
Users can explore the clothing line and look to be prepared to spend a lot of money. The whole project is slightly tongue in cheek.

## Inspiration 

Élan is a luxury e-commerce brand offering an exclusive collection of premium men’s active and leisure wear garments. 
Each piece blends high-performance fabrics with sophisticated design, prioritizing quality, sustainability, and ethical craftsmanship for the modern man seeking versatile, refined style.
Unlike mass-market brands, Élan focuses on fewer, higher quality items, ensuring every garment transitions seamlessly from gym to street.

## Future Enhancements

- Female Clothing Line
- Improve colour scheme. I chose a basic colour scheme for now but would rather experiment with a better colour palette.
- If this was a real clothing brand all imagery would be need to be correctly photographed and not AI slop. 
- Dark Mode

## Stretch Goals

- [ ] Reviews and a star rating system.
- [ ] Countdown timer for home page as to how long the product line will be available
- [ ] Videos and a social media link to the page.
